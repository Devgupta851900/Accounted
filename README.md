# Vite React Express Project

This project uses Vite for the frontend with React and Express.js for the backend. It's set up to run both concurrently with a single command.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start both the frontend and backend concurrently:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will:
- Start the Vite dev server for the frontend
- Start the Express.js server for the backend

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you've configured).
